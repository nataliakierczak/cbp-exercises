Fix it at the bottom of the browser viewport.
Set it's width to be the full width of it's container (the document)
Change it's text color to white.
Change it's background to be black and only 75% opaque
Change the alignment of the text within to be in the center.
Set it's top and bottom padding to be equal to the current font size and it's left and right padding to be equal to 1/2 the current font size. Use relative units to make sure that this padding changes automatically should the font size change.
