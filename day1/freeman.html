        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            <p class="red">
            With an <a href="#">authoritative voice and calm demeanor</a>, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected
            figures in modern US cinema. <span>Morgan</span> was born on <em>June 1, 1937</em> in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a
            teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended <strong>Los Angeles City College</strong> before
            serving several years in the <span style="color: green">US Air Force</span> as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure
            was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical <em>Hello, Dolly!</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <p class="green">
            Freeman first appeared on  <span style="color: green">TV screens</span>  as several characters including <em>"Easy Reader"</em>, <em>"Mel Mounds"</em>            and <em>"Count Dracula"</em> on the <em>Children's Television Workshop</em> (now <em>Sesame Workshop</em>) show
            <em>The Electric Company</em> (1971). He then moved into feature film with another children's adventure, <em>Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow!</em>            (1971). Next, there was a small role in the thriller <em>Blade</em> (1973); then he played Casca in <em>Julius Caesar</em>            (1979) and the title role in <em>Coriolanus</em> (1979). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman
            and he appeared in the prison dramas <a class="seen"<em>Attica</em></a> (1980) and <em>Brubaker</em> (1980), <em>Eyewitness</em>            (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in <em>Death of a Prophet</em> (1981). For most of
            the 1980s, Freeman <a href="#">continued to contribute</a> decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality.

            <p>
                <p class="blue">
                    However, he really stood out, scoring an <a href="http://oscar.go.com/" target="_blank">Oscar</a> nomination as a merciless hoodlum in <em>Street Smart</em> (1987)
            and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097239/" target="movies"><em>Driving Miss Daisy</em></a>           (1989) opposite <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001788/">Jessica Tandy</a>. The same year, Freeman <span style="color: green">teamed up</span> with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel
            Washington in the epic Civil War drama <a class="unseen"href="pages/glory.html"><em>Glory</em></a> (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first
            all-African American fighting brigade.
